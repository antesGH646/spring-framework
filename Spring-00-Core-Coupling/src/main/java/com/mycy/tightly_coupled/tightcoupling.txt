What is tight coupling?
Coupling is the measure of dependency when an object is using another object.
There are two types of coupling tight coupling lose coupling. When an object is
highly dependent on another object to complete its task, it is called tight coupling.
If you add another class to implement additional criteria or business logic, if you
make a change in one place you have to make changes everywhere. If there is an error
in one place it will show up everywhere, because the classes are not only linked, but they
are also highly dependent on each other.
As a developer consider the new keyword as a disadvantage. Not only a performance issue,
but also the management of the class objects becomes complicated.
Approach:
1) Create implementing classes
2) Create a manager class. Meaning a class that has instances of the implementing classes
    and initializes the instances in its constructor. Then, create methods to call the methods
    of the implementing classes.
3) Create a runner class. Since the manager class is accepting instances of the implementing
    classes, new objects of the implementing classes are created. Now an object of the manager
    can call the methods of the manager class
