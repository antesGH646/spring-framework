What is tight coupling?
Coupling is the measure of dependency when an object is using another object.
There are two types of coupling tight coupling lose coupling. When an object is
highly dependent on another object to complete its task, this is called tight coupling
If you add another class for additional criteria or business logic, if make a change
in one place you have to make changes everywhere. If there is an error in one place
there will be a failure everywhere, because the classes are not only linked, but they
are also highly dependent on each other.
As a developer consider the new keyword as a disadvantage. Not only a performance issue,
but also the management of the class objects becomes complicated.
Approach:
1) Implementing classes are created
2) A manager class is created. A class that has instances of the implementing classes and initialize
the instances in its constructor. Methods are created to call the methods of the implementing classes.
3) A runner class is created. Since the manager class is accepting instances of the implementing classes
objects of the implementing classes are created. Now an object of the manager can call
the methods of the manager class
