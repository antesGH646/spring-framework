Business Logic
1) As a user I want to create an account
2) I should be able to see the list of accounts
NB. One user must have two types of accounts saving and checking
3) As a user I should be able to transfer money either into my account
or someone else's account from account only.
4) As a user I should be able to see all the transactions
5) As a user I should be able to block transaction while under construction
(transaction should be blocked during deployment new builds/modifications)
6) As a user I should not be able to transfer if my balance is not enough
for the desired transaction
7) As a user I should not be able to transfer from one account type to the same
account type.
Meaning from my saving to my saving or from saving to the saving account of a different user
